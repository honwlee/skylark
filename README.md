### summary

- Concise

- Anywhere  
Skyalrk.js application is archived a single .slax file. The slax archive can be deployed to web server, and  you can also run it directly on the local desktop.
- Integratable  
Skylark.js core framework focus  functional structure of an application, easy to integrate with jquery, backbone, vue, react and other popular UI framework.

In addition, there are skylark-backbone, skylark-vue (in developping) and so on.
- Configable  
All constituent elements of the application (such as paths, plugins, dependents, and so on)  are configed in  slax-config.json file.
